# Aims

The amis of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS), Harvard University Best Practices for Social Science Software Development are to enable the creation and maintenance of software that is:

-   robust,

-   user-friendly,

-   persistant,

-   attributable,

-   enables reproducible research.

The best practices in this document are intended to be applicable to social science statistical software regardless of the programming language it is written in. Language specific guidelines based on these best practices are documented elsewhere in this repository.

## Best practices

Social science statistical software is more likely to acheive the aims listed above if they have the following characteristics:

1.  Are informatively documented

-   Documentation is automatically generated for each version, in machine and human readable formats.

-   All changes are documented in a "changelog".

2.  Have an open source license

-   For example [GPL (>= 3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

3.  Are comprehensively and automatically tested

4.  Are developed using version control

-   For example, but not limited to [git](https://git-scm.com/)

5.  Are developed in the open using tools and standards that enable external contributions

-   For example, but not limited to [GitHub](https://github.com/)

6.  Are clearly citeable

8.  Are easily findable by the community, shared in public repositories

9.  Use an IQSS Report Card to report their minimal compliance with these Best Practices
