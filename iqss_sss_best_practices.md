**Version 0.0.9000**

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT. The best practices are under review and subject to change.**

# Aims

The amis of the IQSS Best Practices for Social Science Software Development are to enable the creation and maintenance of software that is:

-   robust,

-   user-friendly,

-   persistant,

-   attributable,

-   enables reproducible research.

The best practices in this document are intended to be applicable to social science statistical software regardless of the programming language it is written in. Language specific guidelines based on these best practices will be documented elsewhere.

## Best practices

Social science statistical software is more likely to acheive the aims listed above if they have the following characteristics:

1.  Are informatively documented

2.  Have an open source license

3.  Are comprehensively and automatically tested

4.  Are developed using version control

5.  Are developed in the open using tools that enable external contributions

6.  Are clearly citeable
