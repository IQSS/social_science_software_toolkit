# IQSS Report Card

This directory contains a [spec](iqss_report_card_spec.md) for reporting to what extent a social science statistical software project minimally complies with the IQSS Best Practices.

The specification is designed to be automatically evaluated and as such can only address *minimal* compliance, e.g. whether a testing suite has been set up rather than the quality of the tests.


## Validation

The following packages can evaluate a software package and return an IQSS Report Card written in the following languages:

-   R: [IQSSdevtools](https://github.com/IQSS/IQSSdevtools)
