# R Package Development Quickstart Guide

This Quickstart Guide lays out the general steps you should follow to develop and publish an R package that conforms to the [IQSS Best Practices for R Statistical Software Development](https://github.com/IQSS/social_science_software_toolkit/blob/master/best_practices_per_language/r_best_practices.md).

The [IQSSdevtools package](https://github.com/IQSS/IQSSdevtools) automates much of the work of setting up the package, checking that it can be built/passes its tests, and publishing it. Nonetheless, you have to fill in the package's contents--source code, documentation, many of its tests--manually. For details on how to do this, in the Quickstart Guide we link to relevant sections from Hadley Wickham's (HW) free book [*R Packages*](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).

## 1. Initializing the package

Before loading up R, we recommend setting up a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join), if you haven't done so already. GitHub stores your ([version controlled](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)) code remotely in a GitHub "repository", enables collaboration, and provides a platform for your users to report bugs. . For more details about Git and GitHub see [HW: Git and GitHub](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html).

Once you have a GitHub account you should get your GitHub personal access token. To do this visit the [GitHub tokens website](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Having your personal access token will allow **IQSSdevtools** to create your packages GitHub repository and update it as you make changes to your package.

Once you have your GitHub personal access token, open R and use **IQSSdevtools** to initialise your new R package. For example, imagine we want to start a package called `MyPackage` in our current working directory and our GitHub personal access token is `adfaoihgalkxygoidsn`. Initialize this package using the following code in the R console:

```r
IQSSdevtools::init_iqss_package(path = "MyPackage",
                                github_auth_token = "adfaoihgalkxygoidsn")
```

Running this function will create a new folder called *MyPackage* in your working directory. This folder will contain a "skeleton" R package that includes all of the basic files you will need to meet the IQSS best practives. You should only call this function once. Also, do not store your GitHub personal access token in publicly accessible files, such as a file in your GitHub repository. It should be kept secret.

Now that your package is initialized, you need to manually fill in the package's contents. On your desktop, navigate to the new *MyPackage* folder and add contents to the following folders/files:

-   The *README.Rmd* file: This file will likely be your users' introduction to the package. As such it should include a brief description of the package's purpose, syntax, and a quickstart guide. The package is written using Markdown syntaxâ€“an easy to use markup language. You can create executable examples that are run and the results included in the final output using RMarkdown. For am example, see the [Zelig README](https://github.com/IQSS/Zelig/blob/ivreg/README.Rmd). {BADGES: I want to write a package that will automatically add in the appropriate badges, so that users don't need to think about this}

-   The *DESCRIPTION* file: This contains the package's metadata, e.g. authors' names, a description of what the package does, other packages required by your package, and so on. For details see [HW: Package metadata](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html). In the *DESCRIPTION*, you should include a link to the package's GitHub main page {CHANGE TO OPEN SCHOLAR WHEN AVAILABLE} and [Issues page](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). The latter is a platform for users to contribute to the package's development and report bugs. For example, include in your *DESCRIPTION* file:

```
URL: http://github.com/MyUserName/MyPackage
BugReports: http://github.com/MyUserName/MyPackage/issues
```

-   The *NEWS.md* file: A file written in Markdown where you record all of the major and minor changes that you have made the package for each version. For an example see [Zelig NEWS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/Zelig/master/NEWS.md).

-   The *R* folder: This folder contains all of your package's R source code. You will also use the R source code files you create in this folder to document your code. For details on how to organize your R code see [HW: R](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html) code. For details on how to write package documentation see [HW: Object documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html).

-   **Advanced, but important to do before publishing**--The *tests* folder. This folder contains all of the tests you will use to ensure that your package does what you want it to. For details on how to write R tests see [HW: Testing](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html). `init_iqss_package` also sets up the basic infrastructure for you to run your tests on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/) servers. These services allow you to test that your package is able to build and passes its tests in environments other than locally on your computer. Travis CI runs the tests on a Linux (and optionally macOS) system. Appveyor tests it on Windows. For details on how to set up these tools and implement them in a "test-driven" workflow see the [IQSS R testing webpage](https://github.com/IQSS/social_science_software_toolkit/blob/master/testing/recommended_testing_tools_R.md) {INCOMPLETE}.

## 2. Build, test, and version control your package

During the course of  developing your package, you should regularly build, test, and version control it. Building the package ensures that all of the code is valid (e.g. that all opening brackets `[` are closed `]`) and compiles the documentation. Testing the package ensures that all of the tests you have created in the *tests* folder pass as expected. Also, check that your package meets the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) requirements.  For more details on building and checking packages see [HW: Checking](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html).

After your packages has been built and tested, you want to "[commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)" the changes you have made to [git version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). You want to "[push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/)" these commits to your package's GitHub repository so that they are saved remotely and others can access the files and collaborate on their development.

All three of these steps can be completed with one call of the `build_iqss_package` function from the IQSSdevtools package, e.g.:

```r
IQSSdevtools::build_iqss_package(
        commit_desc = "A brief description of changes since last commit")
```

The `build_iqss_package` function also documents your package's *minimal* compliance with the IQSS Best Practices by generating a [Report Card](https://github.com/IQSS/social_science_software_toolkit/blob/master/report_card/iqss_report_card_spec.md#iqss-report-card-specification). The Report Card is stored in a file within your package called `.iqss_reportcard.yml`.

## 3. Releasing your package

When your package's source code and documentation are written, the package can be built, and passes all tests, you should publish it. To do this use the `publish_package` function from the IQSSdevtools package. This function does the following operations:

-   Runs `build_iqss_package` to make sure the package can be built and passes all tests, updates the IQSS report card, and pushes the code to GitHub.

-   Adds a [git tag](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-tags/) with the current package version number. The git tag makes it easier for contributors to access specific past versions of the package source code on GitHub.

-   Submits the package to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) so that it can be easily installed by users with a call to `install.packages("My Package")`.

### A note on version numbering

Package version numbers are stored in your *DESCRIPTION* file under the `Version` field. Each package release should have an informative version number indicating what kind of release it is. Use a version numbering convention called [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) to indicate to your users how significant a given release is (and so how it might affect their code).

A package version number that follows semantic versioning consists of three numbers separated by periods, e.g. `1.2.3`. The numbers indicate `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` changes. `MAJOR` changes are changes that fundamentally change the package's code such that the release is not completely compatible with previous versions. `MINOR` changes add functionality to a package while being backwards-compatible. `PATCH` changes introduce backwards-compatible bug fixes.

For example, if your current version number is `1.2.3` and you introduce a backwards-compatible bug fix, before you run `publish_package` you should change the `Version` field in your *DESCRIPTION* file to `Version: 1.2.4`.
